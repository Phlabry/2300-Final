Notes

Missing small and big blind system (we can simplify the game by making a default bid amount at the start with 50$, but we have enough time to implement the real system)
Poker game needs to be completely redone
Logic for big and small blind should be a boolean on player or playerNode (probably player), in table assign statuses and in betting auto bet depending on status.
