# 2300-Final

# Poker Game (Java)

A basic implementation of Poker written in Java. Built as a final project for an Object-Oriented Programming course, this project demonstrates principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism, while modeling real-world poker game mechanics including dealing, betting, hand evaluation, and game flow.

This project currently runs in the terminal but **will be expanded into a full graphical user interface (GUI)** version in the near future.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into a few key directories/packages and files. Here's an overview:

### Main Files
- **Main.java**: The driver file that runs the game.

### Model Package (Game Entities)
This package contains the core classes representing the game elements:
- **Card.java**: Defines a single playing card with properties for rank and suit.
- **Deck.java**: Represents a deck of 52 cards and handles the logic for shuffling and dealing cards to players.
- **Hand.java**: Represents a player's hand, containing their dealt cards and the logic to manage them.
- **Player.java**: Represents a player with attributes such as a hand of cards, money, and actions (folding, betting, etc.).
- **PlayerNode.java**: Implements a node in the circular linked list for player management. Helps in managing turns for players in the game.
- **Table.java**: Represents the poker table, managing the players, the pot, and the game state.

### Mechanics Package (Game Logic)
This package contains the core logic of the poker game:
- **PokerGame.java**: Handles the overall game mechanics, such as dealing cards, managing betting rounds, resolving hands, and determining the winner.
- **HandEvaluator.java**: Contains the logic for evaluating poker hands (Royal Flush, Straight, Full House, etc.) and determining the best hand.
- **Betting.java**: Enum that defines the possible betting actions a player can take: FOLD, CHECK, CALL, RAISE, and ALL_IN.

### UI Package (User Interface)
This package handles the graphical user interface components of the game:
- **GameUI.java**: Contains the logic for rendering the game's user interface, allowing players to interact with the game via buttons, menus, and other visual elements.

This structure is designed to separate different parts of the game logic and interface, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
